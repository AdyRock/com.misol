The Misol app for Homey makes it easy for you to add a range of Misol accessories.

This app requires the Misol gateway. You can even add more than one if you need to boost the signal to the far cornsers of your garden.

Let Homey see what the weather is doing outside with the Misol wether station so you can deploy your sunscreens when the solar radiation is hight or retract them if the wind is getting to strong. 
Measure the soil moisture to know when watering is required.
